# Indoor-navigation-algorithms

Here is our public repository with the main focus on indoor navigation algorithms. We’d like to share some useful links, introduce Navigine Demo Applications and Navigine Algorithms.
Navigine Indoor Location Services is a set of unified tools for indoor marketing, analysis, and tracking purposes. The tools’ application scope includes (and is not limited to) airports, shopping malls, universities, and so on.

## Navigine Algorithms

The following sections describe the algorithms implemented in the Navigine products. Refer to the [navigation](https://github.com/Navigine/Indoor-navigation-algorithms/tree/master/navigation) sub-folder for downloads.

### Pedometer

The [pedometer algorithm](https://github.com/Navigine/Indoor-navigation-algorithms/tree/master/navigation/pedometer) implements a method of measuring the current positioning based on the information collected from the device's integrated modules such as:

- accelerometer
- magnetometer
- gyroscope

The algorithm analyses three input acceleration components (ax, ay, az) and the time stamp, and reports the amount of strides, time of each stride, and stride length as the output data.
For details on the algorithm implementation, refer to the [corresponding unit test in GitHub](https://github.com/Navigine/Indoor-navigation-algorithms/blob/master/navigation/pedometer/src/test_pedometer.cpp). 
The considered unit test reads acceleration data from file, fills in the data via the updateAccMeasurements method, and then processes it via the detectSteps method.

Switch to the [corresponding sub-folder](https://github.com/Navigine/Indoor-navigation-algorithms/tree/master/navigation/pedometer) for downloads, or just to review the repository contents.

### Trilateration

This is a method of determining coordinates of a device using measurements of pseudo distances to all visible beacons or signal transmitters. For navigation purposes you may also operate with RSSI readings. We use this algorithm for indoor navigation along with the distance/RSSI measurements from Bluetooth LE 4.0 Beacons.

Algorithm with all required functions and data structures is presented as class in trilateration.h, beacon.h files.

Example of the algorithm usage and filling of data structures you can find in a unit test for this source code in the test_trilateration.cpp file.
